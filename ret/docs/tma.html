    <h2 >What is TMA?</h2>
    <p>
        A Tower Mounted Amplifier (TMA), or Mast Head Amplifier (MHA), is a
        low-noise amplifier (LNA) mounted as close as practical to the
        antenna in mobile masts or base transceiver stations. A TMA reduces
        the base transceiver station noise figure (NF) and therefore
        improves its overall sensitivity; in other words the mobile mast is
        able to receive weaker signals. The power to feed the amplifier (in
        the top of the mast) is usually a DC component on the same coaxial
        cable that feeds the antenna, otherwise an extra power cable has to
        be run to the TMA/MHA to supply it with power.
